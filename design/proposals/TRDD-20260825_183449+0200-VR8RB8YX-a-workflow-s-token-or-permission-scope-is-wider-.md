# a workflow's token or permission scope is wider than the job needs in .github/workflows

## ⏵ STATE — READ THIS FIRST ON RESUME (authoritative; supersedes the body) — 2026-08-25

**PROPOSED BY THE JANITOR — awaiting approval. NOT authorized to execute.**

The janitor detected this in code the **USER owns**, so it may only propose. It has NOT touched
anything and will not, until a human or the main Claude approves by running:

```
/janitor-support-open-ticket TRDD-VR8RB8YX
```

That command opens a support ticket, promotes this TRDD `proposal → planned`, and the janitor's
scheduler dispatches **janitor-security-agent** to fix it at the next free heartbeat slot.

**Finding (a GitHub Actions workflow is vulnerable, severity `medium`):**

**WFSEC-003** (workflow-security, severity `medium`)

**What:** The workflow inherits (or explicitly grants) more privilege than it uses: no `permissions:` block, a broad grant, `secrets: inherit`, an unscoped app token, an ungated `id-token: write`, or a checkout that leaves the token persisted on disk.

**Why it matters:** Every excess grant is blast radius. A compromised step — or one malicious dependency in one action — inherits whatever the job holds, and 'write to contents' is enough to rewrite the repository.

**Fix to attempt:** Declare least privilege: start from an EMPTY `permissions:` map and grant only what each job actually needs; scope app tokens; gate `id-token: write` behind an environment; stop persisting credentials.

**Found:** .github/workflows/build-binaries.yml:153 missing-persist-credentials (HIGH)

**Evidence:**
- `.github/workflows/build-binaries.yml`

## Verification

The dispatched agent is fail-safe: it fixes what is safe and FLAGS what needs a human (it never
rotates credentials, never force-pushes, never pushes to `main`). It returns one line plus a report
path, and closes the ticket with an explicit status.
