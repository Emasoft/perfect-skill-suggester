# Changelog

All notable changes to the Perfect Skill Suggester plugin will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-01-31

### Critical Changes

- **MANDATORY CLEAN SLATE**: Reindexing now ALWAYS performs full regeneration from scratch
- **Phase 0 (Non-Negotiable)**: All previous index data MUST be backed up to /tmp and removed before discovery
- Removed `--force` and `--skill NAME` flags - incremental updates are no longer supported
- Added strict verification step - reindex fails if any old data remains

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed stale version paths (plugins update, old paths remained in index)
- Fixed orphaned entries (deleted skills persisted in index)
- Fixed name mismatches (e.g., "Swift Concurrency" vs `swift-concurrency`)
- Fixed missing new skills when plugins were updated
